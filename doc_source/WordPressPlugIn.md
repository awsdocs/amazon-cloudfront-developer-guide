# Getting started with the AWS for WordPress plugin<a name="WordPressPlugIn"></a>

With the AWS for WordPress plugin, you can set up several AWS services, including Amazon CloudFront\. With CloudFront, you can provide visitors to your WordPress website an accelerated viewing experience with content cached in edge locations around the world\. When visitors come to your website, CloudFront routes them to the edge location that provides the lowest latency for a faster, more reliable experience\.

The AWS for WordPress plugin creates a CloudFront distribution that is optimized for WordPress websites, using multiple cache behaviors to handle the different types of content on your website\. The CloudFront features of the plugin work with websites hosted on [WordPress\.com](https://wordpress.com/) and with self\-hosted WordPress websites on Amazon Lightsail, Amazon EC2, or another web hosting platform\.

You can also use the plugin to set up other AWS services like [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) and [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/), and then configure CloudFront to accelerate the content generated by those services\. For more information about using the plugin to set up Amazon Polly, see [WordPress Plugin for Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/plugin.html) in the *Amazon Polly Developer Guide*\. For more information about using CloudFront to accelerate the content generated by Amazon Polly, see [\(Optional\) Create a CloudFront distribution for Amazon Polly content](#WordPressPlugin-distribution-for-Polly)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="WordPressPlugin-prerequisites"></a>

To use the AWS for WordPress plugin, you need an AWS account, an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, and a WordPress website\.

**Topics**
+ [Creating an AWS account](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-AWS)
+ [Creating an IAM user](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-IAM-user)
+ [Creating a WordPress website](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-WordPress)

### Creating an AWS account<a name="WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-AWS"></a>

If you have an AWS account already, you can skip this section\. Otherwise, create one\.<a name="setting-up-sign-up-for-aws-procedure"></a>

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

### Creating an IAM user<a name="WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-IAM-user"></a>

To use the AWS for WordPress plugin, you must create an *IAM user* for the plugin\. An IAM user is a person or application under an AWS account that has permission to make API calls to AWS services\.

**Note**  
If you don't use [WordPress\.com](https://wordpress.com/) and instead have a self\-hosted WordPress website on Amazon EC2, you can use an IAM role instead of an IAM user\. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.

The following procedure includes the steps to attach an IAM *policy* to the IAM user\. An IAM policy is a document that defines the permissions that apply to the user\.

**To create an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\. Then choose **Add user**\.

1. On the **Set user details** page, do the following:

   1. For **User name**, enter **AWSForWordPressPlugin**\.

   1. For **Access type**, choose **Programmatic access**\.

   1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions** page, do the following:

   1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**\.

   1. In the search box, enter **WordPress**, and then select the check box next to **AWSForWordPressPluginPolicy**\.
**Note**  
The *AWSForWordPressPluginPolicy* is an AWS managed policy that gives the user permission to use all the features included in the AWS for WordPress plugin\. When new features are added to the plugin, AWS will update this policy to include the permissions necessary to use the new features\.

   1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Choose **Create user**\.

1. Choose **Download \.csv** to save the user's credentials \(access key ID and secret access key\) to your computer\. You need them to configure the AWS for WordPress plugin\.
**Important**  
This is the only time that you can save the user's secret access key, so make sure to save it now\.

#### Protect the IAM user’s credentials<a name="WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-protect-credentials"></a>

The IAM user that you created in the preceding section can do the following in your AWS account:
+ Create, modify, tag, list, and delete CloudFront distributions with the tag `"createdBy" : "AWSForWordPressPlugin"`, and create and list invalidations in those distributions\.
+ Request, tag, list, and delete AWS Certificate Manager certificates in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region\.
+ Create AWS CloudFormation stacks in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region, and modify, list, and delete stacks with the tag `"createdBy" : "AWSForWordPressPlugin"`\.
+ Use Amazon Polly to convert text into speech, and list the Amazon Polly voices that are available\.
+ Use Amazon Translate to translate text from one language to another\.
+ Determine whether a particular Amazon S3 bucket exists\.
+ Create Amazon S3 buckets whose names begins with `audio_for_wordpress` or `audio-for-wordpress`, and create, delete, and list objects in those buckets\.

**Important**  
To prevent unauthorized users from gaining these permissions, protect the IAM user's credentials\. Treat the secret access key like a password; store it in a safe place, and don't share it with anyone\. Like a password, [rotate the access key periodically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#rotating_access_keys_console)\. If the secret access key is accidentally leaked, [delete it immediately](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)\. Then you can create a new access key to use with the AWS for WordPress plugin\.

### Creating a WordPress website<a name="WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-WordPress"></a>

If you have a WordPress website already, you can skip ahead to [Step 1: Install the plugin](#WordPressPlugin-install)\.

If you don't have a WordPress website, you can create one using [WordPress\.com](https://wordpress.com/)\. To use the AWS for WordPress plugin, you need a WordPress\.com Business or eCommerce plan\.

You can also install the WordPress software on your own web server, using Amazon Lightsail, Amazon EC2, or another web hosting platform\. Hosting your own WordPress website involves more steps than using WordPress\.com, and requires the ability to configure and manage a web server, a load balancer, DNS records, and web server certificates\.

Regardless of how you set up your WordPress website, you need the following before you can use the AWS for WordPress plugin:
+ Your website must have its own *domain name*\. A domain name, also known as a *web address* or a *URL \(uniform resource locator\)*, is the address that visitors use to go to your website\. For example, Amazon's domain name is *amazon\.com*\. In this topic, we use *example\.com* as a generic example domain name, but you need a custom domain name for your website\.
+ Your website must work using HTTPS\. This is a security best practice, and the plugin assumes that your website works using HTTPS\. To check, go to your website's address using HTTPS \(for example, ***https**://example\.com*\) and make sure that your website displays correctly\.

For a step\-by\-step tutorial that explains how to create a WordPress website on AWS using Amazon Lightsail, see [Accelerating WordPress with CloudFront using the AWS for WordPress Plugin](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/accelerating-wordpress-with-cloudfront-using-the-aws-for-wordpress-plugin/) on the AWS Networking and Content Delivery blog\.

When your website has a domain name and works using HTTPS, proceed to the following section\.

## Step 1: Install the plugin<a name="WordPressPlugin-install"></a>

Before you install the plugin, make sure to complete the [prerequisites](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites)\.

**To install the plugin**

1. Log in to the admin dashboard for your WordPress website, also known as **WP Admin**\.

1. Choose **Plugins**\.

1. 
   + If you already have the **Amazon AI** \(the plugin's previous name\) or **AWS for WordPress** plugin:

     1. Select the check box next to **Amazon AI** or **AWS for WordPress**\.

     1. In the **Bulk Action** menu, choose **Update**, and then choose **Apply**\.
   + If you don't have the **Amazon AI** or **AWS for WordPress** plugin:

     1. Choose **Add New**\.

     1. In the search box, enter **AWS for WordPress**\.

     1. Find the **AWS for WordPress** plugin\. Choose **Install Now**, and then choose **Activate**\.

After you activate the plugin, proceed to the following section to configure and use it\.

## Step 2: Configure and use CloudFront with the plugin<a name="WordPressPlugin-configure-use"></a>

When you use CloudFront with the AWS for WordPress plugin for site acceleration, the plugin uses a *subdomain*, also known as an *alternate domain name* or *CNAME*, to send your website's traffic through CloudFront\. This can reduce latency and improve the viewing experience by loading resources faster\.

Without the plugin's site acceleration, all the traffic of your website's viewers goes to the server that hosts your WordPress website\. After completing the steps in the following procedure, you can enable the plugin's site acceleration, which gives viewers two options for visiting your website:
+ When viewers use your website's domain name, such as *example\.com*, all the traffic goes through CloudFront, except for the website's index page and a few small image files\.
+ When viewers use your website's alternate domain name, such as *www\.example\.com*, all the traffic goes through CloudFront\.

Using either domain, your website's viewers get lower latency and a faster, more reliable viewing experience\. We recommend telling viewers to use your website's alternate domain name\. The following diagrams show your viewers' traffic with and without the plugin's site acceleration\.

![\[Diagram of a website viewer's traffic going to the WordPress website host.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/wp-plugin-no-acceleration.png)

![\[Diagram of a website viewer's traffic going to the CloudFront edge locations.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/wp-plugin-with-acceleration.png)

**To configure and use CloudFront with the plugin \(enable site acceleration\)**

1. Log in to the admin dashboard for your WordPress website, also known as **WP Admin**\.

1. In the left navigation, choose **AWS**\.

1. Paste or enter the access key ID and secret access key [that you saved previously](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites), and then choose **Save Changes**\.
**Note**  
If you host WordPress on Amazon EC2, you can skip this step and use an IAM role instead of an IAM user\. In that case, keep these two fields blank\. For more information about IAM roles, see [IAM Roles for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.
**Note**  
Regardless of what you choose for **AWS Region**, the plugin's CloudFront feature creates all resources in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **CloudFront**\.

1. On the **CloudFront Setup** page, do the following:

   1. If necessary, for **Origin Domain Name**, enter your website's domain name, for example, *example\.com*\.

   1. For **CloudFront Alternate Domain Name**, enter a subdomain that viewers will use for your website's accelerated experience\. We recommend using *www* in front of your website's domain name, for example, *www\.example\.com*\.

   1. Choose **Initiate Setup**\.

1. CloudFront uses AWS Certificate Manager to create a certificate for your alternate domain name, and you must validate the certificate within 72 hours of the request\. Do this by adding the DNS record that the plugin shows on the setup page\. The process for adding this validation record varies depending on your DNS service provider\. If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to update DNS records with a custom entry\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Creating Records by Using the Amazon Route 53 Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

   After you add the DNS record, return to the setup page and choose **Check status of SSL certificate**\.

   When you complete this step, CloudFront sets up a distribution that is optimized for WordPress\. This process can take some time to deploy globally\. The setup page automatically refreshes every ten seconds to keep you updated while the deployment is in progress\.

1. After the deployment is complete, create a DNS record to point your alternative domain name \(for example, *www\.example\.com*\) to your new CloudFront distribution\. Do this by adding the DNS record that the plugin shows on the setup page\. The process for adding this validation record varies depending on your DNS service provider\. If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to update DNS records with a custom entry\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Creating Records by Using the Amazon Route 53 Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

   After you add the DNS record, return to the setup page and choose **Check status of CloudFront DNS record**\.

1. Choose **Activate Site Acceleration**, and then choose **Save Changes**\.

When you activate site acceleration, the AWS for WordPress plugin configures your website to serve the website's resources—for example, CSS and JavaScript files, and images—from your CloudFront distribution\. You can verify that the plugin accelerates your website for viewers by viewing your website from a private browsing window, or by using a different browser outside of WordPress's admin mode\. Make sure that you navigate to your website using the alternate domain name, for example, *www\.example\.com*\.

## \(Optional\) Deactivate site acceleration<a name="WordPressPlugin-deactivate"></a>

You can deactivate site acceleration to serve all of your website's resources from your web server host, bypassing the CloudFront distribution\. This leaves your distribution intact and available for use when you choose to reactivate the plugin's site acceleration\.

**Warning**  
Before you deactivate site acceleration, edit the DNS record for your alternative domain name \(such as *www\.example\.com*\) so that it points to your website's domain \(such as *example\.com*\)\. If you don't do this first, you might experience downtime or problems with your website\. After you edit the DNS record, wait longer than the record's time to live \(TTL\) value before deactivating site acceleration\.  
If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to edit DNS records\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Editing Records ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-editing.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

**To deactivate site acceleration**

1. Log in to your WordPress website, and then choose **WP Admin**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AWS**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **CloudFront**\.

1. Clear the **Activate Site Acceleration** check box, and then choose **Save Changes**\.

Deactivating site acceleration is reversible\. To reactivate it, select the **Activate Site Acceleration** check box, and then choose **Save Changes**\.

## \(Optional\) Remove site acceleration and delete the CloudFront distribution<a name="WordPressPlugin-remove-delete-distribution"></a>

You can use the AWS for WordPress plugin to delete your CloudFront distribution\. This is not reversible\. To use the AWS for WordPress plugin for site acceleration again, you must [reconfigure the plugin](#WordPressPlugin-configure-use), which creates a new CloudFront distribution\.

**Warning**  
Before you delete your CloudFront distribution, edit the DNS record for your alternative domain name \(such as *www\.example\.com*\) so that it points to your website's domain \(such as *example\.com*\)\. If you don't do this first, you might experience downtime or problems with your website\. After you edit the DNS record, wait longer than the record's time to live \(TTL\) value before deleting your CloudFront distribution\.  
If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to edit DNS records\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Editing Records ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-editing.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

**To remove site acceleration and delete your CloudFront distribution**

1. Log in to your WordPress website, and then choose **WP Admin**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AWS**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **CloudFront**\.

1. Choose **Remove Site Acceleration**, and then choose **OK**\.

When you complete these steps, the AWS for WordPress plugin deletes your CloudFront distribution\. This can take several minutes to complete\. After the process is complete, you can optionally open the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) to verify that the CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager, and AWS CloudFormation resources created by the plugin are deleted\.

## \(Optional\) Deactivate and remove the plugin<a name="WordPressPlugin-deactivate-remove-plugin"></a>

You can deactivate the AWS for WordPress plugin to stop using all of its features for CloudFront and other AWS services\. You can also delete the plugin to remove it from your WordPress website completely\.

**Warning**  
Before you deactivate and delete the plugin, edit the DNS record for your alternative domain name \(such as *www\.example\.com*\) so that it points to your website's domain \(such as *example\.com*\)\. If you don't do this first, you might experience downtime or problems with your website\. After you edit the DNS record, wait longer than the record's time to live \(TTL\) value before deactivating and deleting the plugin\.  
If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to edit DNS records\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Editing Records ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-editing.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
If you deactivate and delete the plugin without first removing site acceleration, the plugin does not delete the CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager, and AWS CloudFormation resources that it created\. These resources remain in your AWS account, and you are charged for any usage that exceeds the [AWS Free Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/)\. To delete these resources before deleting the plugin, see [\(Optional\) Remove site acceleration and delete the CloudFront distribution](#WordPressPlugin-remove-delete-distribution)\.

**To deactivate the AWS for WordPress plugin**

### Can't connect to AWS<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-connect-to-AWS"></a>

The plugin might display the following error: Can't connect to AWS\. Check your credentials and make sure your AWS account is active\. If you see this error, try the following:
+ Make sure that you entered your AWS access key and AWS secret key in the plugin's **General configuration** page\. For more information, see [Step 2: Configure and use CloudFront with the plugin](#WordPressPlugin-configure-use)\.
+ Make sure that the IAM user that you created for the plugin has the correct permissions\. For more information, see [Creating an IAM user](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-IAM-user)\.

### User is not authorized<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-access-denied"></a>

The plugin might display the following error messages:
+ Error in Setup
+ AccessDenied
+ User: *<user ARN>* is not authorized to perform *<action>*

If you see one of these errors, make sure that the IAM user that you created for the plugin has the correct permissions\. For more information, see [Creating an IAM user](#WordPressPlugin-prerequisites-IAM-user)\.

### CloudFront settings page is blank<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-CloudFront-blank-page"></a>

When you navigate to the plugin's CloudFront settings page, the page might be blank\. This means that you haven't entered your AWS access key and AWS secret key in the plugin's **General configuration** page\. For more information, see [Step 2: Configure and use CloudFront with the plugin](#WordPressPlugin-configure-use)\.

### DescribeCertificate error<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-IP-address"></a>

The plugin might display the following error messages:
+ Error in Setup
+ Found 1 error while validating the input provided for the DescribeCertificate operation: \[CertificateArn\] expected string length to be >= 20, but found string length of 0

If you see one of these errors, choose **Restart Setup**, and then make sure that you enter a domain name, not an IP address, for **Origin Domain Name** and **CloudFront Alternate Domain Name**\. For more information, see [Step 2: Configure and use CloudFront with the plugin](#WordPressPlugin-configure-use)\.

### AWS CloudFormation error<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-CloudFormation-error"></a>

The plugin might display the following error messages:
+ Caught exception in method AmazonAI\_Cloudformation
+ Stack is in an unexpected state\. CloudFront Distribution state is: *<distribution state>* and Stack state is: *stack state*

If you see one of these errors, choose **Restart Setup** to try again\. If you're comfortable diagnosing errors using the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1), you can open the console to see what went wrong\.

### CloudFront distribution deployment seems stuck<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-setup-seems-stuck"></a>

When setting up site acceleration, the plugin might show the **CloudFront Distribution Deployment** step for a long time, and it might seem like the plugin is stuck at this step\. This step can take several minutes to complete\. The plugin refreshes every ten seconds during this step, and displays a message like this: Last updated at *<date and time of last update>*\. Look for this message to see when the plugin last refreshed the page\. If it was within the last minute, we recommend that you continue to wait for this step to complete\. If the plugin has not refreshed in a while, you can try reloading the page\.

### Alternate domain is not working<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-alternate-domain-not-working"></a>

If you finished setting up CloudFront with the plugin but your alternate domain name \(for example, *www\.example\.com*\) isn't working, make sure that you added a CNAME record to your DNS records\. If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to update DNS records with a custom entry\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Creating Records by Using the Amazon Route 53 Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

If you used the plugin to delete your CloudFront distribution and your alternate domain name \(for example, *www\.example\.com*\) isn't working, make sure that you updated your DNS records to repoint the alternate domain name to your website's apex domain \(for example, *example\.com*\) and that you've waited longer than the DNS record's time to live \(TTL\) value\. If you use WordPress\.com hosting services, see [their documentation](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/custom-dns/) for information about how to update DNS records with a custom entry\. If you use Amazon Route 53 for DNS, see [Creating Records by Using the Amazon Route 53 Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

### Can’t find AWS resources<a name="WordPressPlugin-troubleshooting-locate-AWS-resources"></a>

The CloudFront feature of the plugin creates resources in several AWS services, including CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager, and AWS CloudFormation\. If you're looking for these resources in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) or listing them using an API, make sure that you use the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region \(us\-east\-1\)\.
