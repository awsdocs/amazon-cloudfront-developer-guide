You can also now set up CloudFront with origin failover for scenarios that require high availability\. For more information, see [ Using WebSocket with CloudFront Distributions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-working-with.websockets.html) and [ Optimizing High Availability with CloudFront Origin Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html)\.  |  November 20, 2018  |
